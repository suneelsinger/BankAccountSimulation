**Project Title:** Bank Account Simulation

**Description:**
The *Bank Account Simulation* project is a Java-based application designed to model basic banking operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It demonstrates the core functionalities of account management, including deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries, while maintaining a transaction history for each account.

This project aims to simulate real-world banking scenarios in a simplified environment, allowing users to interact with the system through input/output operations. It emphasizes the use of encapsulation, method design, and class-based structures to create a modular and reusable codebase.

**Key Features:**

* Account creation with unique identifiers.
* Deposit and withdrawal operations with balance validation.
* Real-time account balance updates.
* Transaction history tracking for transparency.
* User interaction through console-based input/output.

**Outcome:**
The project provides a practical demonstration of Java OOP concepts while simulating essential banking functionalities. It showcases how software systems can model real-world financial operations, making it a valuable learning exercise for understanding class design, data management, and user interaction.
